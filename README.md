# Evolve MVP ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

This repo contains the source code of the prototype version of a web application which allows making national and international online payments between companies in an instantaneous, safe, transparent and low cost way.

The project arises from the need to reduce the long waiting times incurred and the high rates charged by financial intermediaries in the online transactions of financial assets between companies. Additionally, the project is also driven by the need to increase security in the processes of transferring financial assets between companies in the current platforms through which they make their payments.

## Built with

- Backend: GraphQL, ApolloServer and MongoDB.
- Frontend: React and ApolloClient

## Getting started

### Clone and start locally

Run both server and payments client (see README docs of them).

ðŸ‘‰ Ensure that you add properly your mongo server url as `.env` variable in the server.
